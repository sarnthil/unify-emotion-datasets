### Emotion data Aman

* Authors: Aman Saima
* Description: Identifying emotions in text
* Size: 15205 sentences (173 blogposts)
* Categories: happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, fear, ne (no emotion)
* Annotation: emotion category label + emotion intensity label + emotion idicators
* Approaches:
* Link: ?
* Terms/License: Available upon request

#### Format
The files AnnotSet1.txt and AnnotSet2.txt are annotated one sentence per line, with:

    <id> <emotion category label> <emotion intensity label> <emotion indicators>

- _id_ is a number followed by a dot.
- _emotion category label_ is one of: `hp` (happiness), `sd` (sadness), `ag` (anger), `dg` (disgust), `sp` (surprise), `fr` (fear), or `ne` (no emotion). If the emotion category label is "ne" (no emotion), the line ends here.
- _emotion intensity label_ is one of: `h` (high), `l` (low), or `m` (medium)
- _emotion indicators_ are the words that were found by annotators to be emotionally charged. They are sometimes (but not always) seperated by commas.

basefile.txt contains the corresponding sentences, one sentence per line. Each sentence is preceeded by its number, a dot, and a space.

blogdata.txt is an XML file.

The file category_gold_std.txt contains all those sentences for which the annotators agreed on the emotion category and has the following format:

    <emotion category label> <sentence number> <sentence>

Similarly intensity_gold_std.txt contains all those sentences for which agreement on emotion intensity was met and has the following format:

    <emotion intensity label> <sentence number> <sentence>

#### Sample:
first set (Annotator A) AnnotSet1.txt:
`43. hp m played, fun, baby, games`

second set (Annotators B,C and D) AnnotSet2.txt:
`43. hp m fun baby games`

basefile.txt
`43. We played fun baby games and caught up on some old times.`

unannotated data: blogdata.txt

    <block id="block 3">
      <!-- ... -->
      <resource id="3.43">We played fun baby games and caught up on some old times.</resource>
      <!-- ... -->
    </block>

category_gold_std.txt:
`p 43. We played fun baby games and caught up on some old times.`

intensity_gold_std.txt:
`m 43. We played fun baby games and caught up on some old times.`

### EmoBank

* Authors: Sven Buechel
* Description: A large-scale text corpus manually annotated with emotion according to the psychological Valence-Arousal-Dominance scheme.
* Size: 10k sentences balancing multiple genres
* Categories:
* Annotation: Each sentence was annotated according to both the emotion which is expressed by the writer, and the emotion which is perceived by the readers.
* Approaches:
* Link: https://github.com/JULIELab/EmoBank
* Terms/License: 

#### Format:

The folder `corpus` contains four tsv files and one script in R.
The file  raw.tsv contains the textual data of this corpus (id	sentence)
The file  meta.tsv contains genre-information (id	document	category	subcategory)
The files reader.tsv and writer.tsv contain the emotion meta-data for the writer and reader perspective
(id	Arousal	Dominance	Valence	sd.Arousal	sd.Dominance	sd.Valence	freq)

These meta-data files contain columns for the three emotional dimensions (Valence, Arousal and Dominance) as well as the standard deviation of the human ratings for the individual item. The last column, "freq", gives the number of valid ratings for this item (after the filtering process described in the paper).

The IDs for sentences taken from MASC follow the pattern \<documentName>\_\<beginIndex>\_\<endIndex> which refers to the file names and the sentence boundary annotations as included in the MASC release 3.0.0. For the news headlines taken from SemEval, the IDs follow the pattern SemEval\_\<originalSemEvalId>.

The script combine.R combines those individual files into a single R data frame

#### Sample:
raw.tsv:
`Acephalous-Cant-believe_4_47	I can't believe I wrote all that last year.`

meta.tsv:
`Acephalous-Cant-believe_4_47	Acephalous-Cant-believe	blog	 .`

reader.tsv:
`110CYL068_1036_1079	3.2	3	3	0.4	0	0	5`

writer.tsv:
`110CYL068_1036_1079	2.8	3.4	3	0.979795897113271	0.489897948556636	0	5`

- actually this could be extended for all emotions. why didn't they include all emotions?

### ISEAR (International Survey On Emotion Antecedents And Reactions)
* Authors: Klaus R. Scherer and Harald Wallbott
* Description: Over a period of many years during the 1990s, a large group of psychologists all over the world collected data in the ISEAR project, directed by Klaus R. Scherer and Harald Wallbott. Student respondents, both psychologists and non-psychologists, were asked to report situations in which they had experienced all of 7 major emotions (joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, and guilt). In each case, the questions covered the way they had appraised the situation and how they reacted. The final data set thus contained reports on seven emotions each by close to 3000 respondents in 37 countries on all 5 continents.
* Size: 3000 respondents
